# POO-JavaRMI-Hello
Simple example used to teach distributed objects in the OOP course

Based on Oracle's Java RMI Guide: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/rmi/hello/hello-world.html

It is composed by three files:

- Hello.java: description of the remote object's interface
- Server.java: implementation of the remote object + code to start a server process where the object will run
- Client.java: a simple client to demonstrate the invocation of method's on the remote object.

### First, install the JDK on the machines:
  sudo apt install default-jdk

Try adding other methods to the remote object and calling them from the client.
